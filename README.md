# taskmaster-predictions-with-machine-learning
Taskmaster is a  comedy panel game show. In each series of the programme, a group of five celebrities (mainly comedians) attempt to complete a series of challenges, referred to as "tasks". The Taskmaster then reviews the contestants' attempts and awards points based on performance, interpretation or other arbitrary, comedic factors. A winner is determined in each episode and for the series overall. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taskmaster_(TV_series)))

Using historical Taskmaster data, I built a machine learning model to predict contestants’ final series performance using only first-episode results. 

The project explores how informative early performance is in a partially subjective competition and evaluates whether simple, interpretable models can meaningfully predict long-term outcomes.
